BioSentinel™ — Agentic AI Bioshield for Biowarfare &amp; Pandemic Defense

# 🧬 BioSentinel™ — Agentic AI Bioshield for Biowarfare & Pandemic Defense

> **A LangChain + CrewAI-powered intelligent biosurveillance and biodefense simulation platform** that detects, classifies, and counters bio-threats—natural or synthetic—before they escalate into outbreaks or engineered pandemics.

---

## 🌐 Overview

**BioSentinel™** simulates a real-time, AI-orchestrated defense system against biological warfare, lab accidents, and pandemics. Inspired by missile defense and cyber domes, BioSentinel creates an **agent-based bioshield**, monitoring global health data, genomic mutations, and biothreat vectors using LLM-powered reasoning and orchestrated workflows.

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🧬 Pathogen Genomics Layer | Analyzes emerging strains for engineered gene edits or unusual mutational signatures |
| 📡 Syndromic Surveillance Layer | Monitors real-time signals from hospital records, environmental sensors, and public sentiment |
| 🧠 Threat Reasoning & Classification | Uses AI agents to classify outbreak origins: zoonotic, engineered, accidental |
| ⚕️ Response Planning & Containment | Simulates real-time mitigation: quarantines, treatment algorithms, vaccine push |
| ⚖️ Human-in-the-Loop Ethics | CrewAI agents apply policy ethics based on WHO/CDC/FDA/UN guidance |

## 🧬 Agent Roles

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🧫 `PathogenWatchAgent` | Screens genetic sequences for anomalies, gain-of-function risks |
| 📡 `SyndromicSurveillanceAgent` | Parses patient clusters, search trends, social signals |
| 🔬 `BioThreatClassifierAgent` | Categorizes threat (natural, lab leak, bioweapon) with reasoning chain |
| 🧪 `ResponseModelAgent` | Simulates countermeasure rollout based on AI-epidemic modeling |
| 🧑‍⚖️ `BioEthicsReviewAgent` | Intercepts agent actions for ethical governance and legal compliance |
| 🧠 `StrategicBioshieldAgent` | Directs overall mission across agents and handles global-level policy execution |
